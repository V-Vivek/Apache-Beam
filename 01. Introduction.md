## Introduction to Apache Beam

- **B**atch + Str**eam** -> Beam
- [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) is an open-source, unified & portable programming model designed for defining and executing data processing workflows.
- It enables the development of **batch** and **stream** processing pipelines.
- Note that beam is a programming model and not a execution engine. Hence, it will be invalid to compare Beam with Spark.

### Key Features of Apache Beam

- **Unified Model**:
    - Apache Beam provides a consistent model for both batch and stream processing, allowing developers to write pipelines that can handle both types of data.
    - 1 unified API to process both Batch & Streaming data
- **Portable**:
    - Beam pipeline once creted in any language can be able to run on any execution engines.
    - Beam pipelines can be executed on various execution engines, known as runners.
    - Some popular runners include Apache Flink, Apache Spark, and Google Cloud Dataflow.
- **Language Support**:
    - Beam supports multiple programming languages like Java, Python, Go, etc.
- **Extensibility**:
    - Beam's architecture allows for easy integration with different data sources and sinks, including cloud storage, databases, and messaging systems.

### Basic Concepts

- **Pipeline**: A pipeline represents the entire data processing workflow.
- **PCollection**: A PCollection is a distributed data set that serves as the input and output of each step in the pipeline.
- **Transform**: Transforms are operations that process data in PCollections. Examples include ParDo, GroupByKey, and Combine.
- **I/O**: I/O connectors in Beam allow pipelines to read from and write to various data sources and sinks.

### Example

Here's a simple example of an Apache Beam pipeline written in Python:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        (pipeline
         | 'Read' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('input.txt')
         | 'Process' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x.upper())
         | 'Write' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output.txt'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
