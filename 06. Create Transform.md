## Create Transform in Apache Beam

### Overview

The `Create` transform in Apache Beam is used to create a `PCollection` from an in-memory data structure, such as a list, tuple, or other iterable. This is useful for generating test data or for creating small data sets directly within your pipeline code.

### Usage

The `Create` transform is simple to use and requires only the data to be wrapped inside it. Here's a basic example:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        # Define the data
        data = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

        # Create a PCollection from the data
        fruits = pipeline | 'CreateFruits' >> beam.Create(data)

        # Write the PCollection to a text file
        fruits | 'WriteFruits' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

**Parameters**:

- `data`: The in-memory data structure to be converted into a `PCollection`. This can be a list, tuple, or any iterable.

**Key Points**:

- **In-Memory Data**: Create is typically used for small data sets that can fit in memory. It's not designed for large-scale data ingestion.
- **Immediate Evaluation**: The Create transform immediately evaluates the data when the pipeline runs, making it suitable for static data that doesn't change during pipeline execution.

**Example**:
Here is an example demonstrating how to use the Create transform in a pipeline that processes a list of integers:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        # Define the data
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

        # Create a PCollection from the data
        pcollection = pipeline | 'CreateNumbers' >> beam.Create(numbers)

        # Apply a transformation (e.g., square each number)
        squared_numbers = pcollection | 'SquareNumbers' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x * x)

        # Write the result to a text file
        squared_numbers | 'WriteNumbers' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```
