## Map, FlatMap, and Filter Transforms in Apache Beam

### Overview

Apache Beam provides powerful transforms such as `Map`, `FlatMap`, and `Filter` to manipulate and process data within a pipeline. These transforms are essential for data transformation tasks, allowing you to apply functions to each element of a `PCollection`.

### Map Transform

The `Map` transform applies a simple 1-to-1 function to each element of a `PCollection`. It takes an input element and produces a single output element.

**Usage**:
```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        
        output = (pipeline
                  | 'CreateInput' >> beam.Create(input_data)
                  | 'Square' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x * x))

        output | 'WriteOutput' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_map.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

In this example:

- beam.Create initializes the pipeline with a list of numbers.
- beam.Map applies a lambda function to square each number.
- The result is written to an output text file.

### FlatMap Transform
The FlatMap transform applies a function that returns an iterable to each element of a PCollection and then flattens the iterables into a single PCollection. This allows a single input element to produce multiple output elements.

**Usage**:
```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        input_data = ['apple banana', 'cherry date']
        
        output = (pipeline
                  | 'CreateInput' >> beam.Create(input_data)
                  | 'SplitWords' >> beam.FlatMap(lambda x: x.split(' ')))

        output | 'WriteOutput' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_flatmap.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

In this example:

- beam.Create initializes the pipeline with a list of strings.
- beam.FlatMap applies a lambda function to split each string into words.
- The result is written to an output text file.

### Filter Transform
The Filter transform applies a predicate function to each element of a PCollection and produces a PCollection containing only the elements that satisfy the predicate.

**Usage**:
```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        input_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
        
        output = (pipeline
                  | 'CreateInput' >> beam.Create(input_data)
                  | 'FilterEvenNumbers' >> beam.Filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0))

        output | 'WriteOutput' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_filter.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

In this example:

- beam.Create initializes the pipeline with a list of numbers.
- beam.Filter applies a lambda function to filter out only even numbers.
- The result is written to an output text file.
