## Pipeline Branching in Apache Beam

### Overview

Pipeline branching in Apache Beam allows you to split a `PCollection` into multiple branches, each performing different operations or transformations. This enables parallel processing of the same data set in different ways.

### Independent Branch Processing
- In Apache Beam, each transform operates independently, and the pipeline manages parallel execution.
- In below code we have written `beam.io.WriteToText()` at the end of both the branches but this does not mean that files will be created after execution of both branches.
- Let's say Branch 1 completes quickly and Branch 2 takes some time.
- But the files for Branch 1 will be created as soon as Branch 1 is completed and it will not wait for Branch 2 to complete.

### Example Scenario

Consider an example where we have a list of numbers, and we want to perform two different operations on this data:
1. Calculate the square of each number.
2. Filter out even numbers.

### Implementation

Below is an example demonstrating pipeline branching using Apache Beam:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

        # Create the initial PCollection
        numbers_pcoll = pipeline | 'CreateNumbers' >> beam.Create(numbers)

        # Branch 1: Square each number
        squared_numbers = (numbers_pcoll
                           | 'SquareNumbers' >> beam.Map(lambda x: x * x))

        # Branch 2: Filter even numbers
        even_numbers = (numbers_pcoll
                        | 'FilterEvenNumbers' >> beam.Filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0))

        # Write outputs to separate files
        squared_numbers | 'WriteSquaredNumbers' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_squared.txt')
        even_numbers | 'WriteEvenNumbers' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_even.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

**Explanation**

1. Pipeline Creation:
    - beam.Pipeline(): Initializes the pipeline.
    - beam.Create(numbers): Creates a PCollection from the list of numbers.

2. Branch 1:
    - beam.Map(lambda x: x * x): Applies the Map transform to square each number.
    - beam.io.WriteToText('output_squared.txt'): Writes the squared numbers to a text file.

3. Branch 2:
    - beam.Filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0): Applies the Filter transform to select only even numbers.
    - beam.io.WriteToText('output_even.txt'): Writes the even numbers to a text file.

### Advanced Example
Let's consider a more complex example where we have a PCollection of dictionaries representing user data, and we want to branch the pipeline to:

- Extract and process user names.
- Extract and process user ages.

**Example**:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        users = [
            {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30},
            {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25},
            {'name': 'Charlie', 'age': 35}
        ]

        # Create the initial PCollection
        users_pcoll = pipeline | 'CreateUsers' >> beam.Create(users)

        # Branch 1: Extract and process user names
        user_names = (users_pcoll
                      | 'ExtractNames' >> beam.Map(lambda user: user['name'])
                      | 'ProcessNames' >> beam.Map(lambda name: name.upper()))

        # Branch 2: Extract and process user ages
        user_ages = (users_pcoll
                     | 'ExtractAges' >> beam.Map(lambda user: user['age'])
                     | 'ProcessAges' >> beam.Map(lambda age: age + 1))

        # Write outputs to separate files
        user_names | 'WriteUserNames' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_names.txt')
        user_ages | 'WriteUserAges' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_ages.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

**Explanation**

1. Pipeline Creation:
    - beam.Create(users): Creates a PCollection from the list of user dictionaries.

2. Branch 1:
    - beam.Map(lambda user: user['name']): Extracts the name field from each user dictionary.
    - beam.Map(lambda name: name.upper()): Converts each name to uppercase.
    - beam.io.WriteToText('output_names.txt'): Writes the processed names to a text file.

3. Branch 2:
    - beam.Map(lambda user: user['age']): Extracts the age field from each user dictionary.
    - beam.Map(lambda age: age + 1): Increments each age by 1.
    - beam.io.WriteToText('output_ages.txt'): Writes the processed ages to a text file.

### Conclusion
Pipeline branching in Apache Beam allows for flexible and parallel processing of data, enabling multiple transformations to be applied to the same PCollection. By using branching, you can efficiently perform different operations on your data within the same pipeline, facilitating complex data processing workflows.
