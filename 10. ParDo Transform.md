## ParDo Transform in Apache Beam

### Overview

- `ParDo` is one of the most powerful and flexible transforms in Apache Beam.
- It stands for "Parallel Do" and is used to perform parallel processing of elements in a `PCollection`.
- `ParDo` allows you to define complex data processing logic using a user-defined function, encapsulated within a `DoFn` class.

### Functionalities
- **Filtering**: ParDo can take each element of PCollection and decide either to output or discard it.
- **Formatting or Type conversion**: ParDo can change the type or format of input elements.
- **Extracting individual Parts**: ParDo can be used to extract individual elements from a single element.
- **Computations**: ParDo can perform any processing function on the input elements and outputs a PCollection.

### Key Components

1. **`DoFn` Class**:
   - `DoFn` stands for "Do Function". It is a user-defined function that processes each element in the input `PCollection`.
   - `DoFn` contains a `process` method that receives an element from the input `PCollection` and emits zero or more elements as output.

2. **`ParDo` Transform**:
   - `ParDo` applies the `DoFn` to each element in the input `PCollection` in parallel.
   - It can handle complex processing logic that can't be easily expressed using simple transforms like `Map`, `FlatMap`, or `Filter`.

### Example

Let's consider an example where we want to process a `PCollection` of text lines. For each line, we want to split it into words and emit each word as a separate element.

**Example Code**:

```python
import apache_beam as beam

class SplitWordsFn(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        return element.split()

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        lines = [
            'hello world',
            'apache beam is powerful',
            'use ParDo for parallel processing'
        ]

        words = (pipeline
                 | 'CreateLines' >> beam.Create(lines)
                 | 'SplitIntoWords' >> beam.ParDo(SplitWordsFn()))

        words | 'WriteWords' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_words.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

### Explanation
1. DoFn Class:
    - `SplitWordsFn`: This class inherits from beam.DoFn.
    - `process Method`: This method takes each input element (a line of text) and splits it into words using the split method. It returns a list of words.

2. ParDo Transform:
    - `beam.ParDo(SplitWordsFn())`: This applies the SplitWordsFn to each element in the input PCollection. For each line of text, it emits multiple words as separate elements.

3. Pipeline Creation:
    - `beam.Create(lines)`: Initializes the pipeline with a list of text lines.
    - `beam.io.WriteToText('output_words.txt')`: Writes the output words to a text file.

### Advanced Usage
ParDo can also use additional features such as:

- **Side Inputs**: Provide additional data to your DoFn.
- **Side Outputs**: Produce multiple output PCollections from a single ParDo.
- **Windowing**: Apply windowing to your PCollection for more complex processing scenarios.

### Side Inputs Example
Here is an example of using ParDo with side inputs:
```python
import apache_beam as beam

class SplitWordsFn(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        return element.split()

class FilterWordsFn(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element, threshold):
        if len(element) > threshold:
            yield element

def run():
    with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
        lines = [
            'hello world',
            'apache beam is powerful',
            'use ParDo for parallel processing'
        ]

        threshold = 4

        filtered_words = (pipeline
                          | 'CreateLines' >> beam.Create(lines)
                          | 'SplitIntoWords' >> beam.ParDo(SplitWordsFn())
                          | 'FilterLongWords' >> beam.ParDo(FilterWordsFn(), threshold))

        filtered_words | 'WriteFilteredWords' >> beam.io.WriteToText('output_filtered_words.txt')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run()
```

**In this example**:

- FilterWordsFn filters out words shorter than the given threshold.
- beam.ParDo(FilterWordsFn(), threshold): The threshold parameter is passed as a side input to the FilterWordsFn.
